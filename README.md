## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a web developer currently exploring animations and interactivity on the web using Framer Motion. This repository is a collection of my experiments, practice projects, and creative explorations as I learn how to add fluid motion and engaging transitions to modern user interfaces.

Bringing interfaces to life with motion is something Iâ€™ve grown increasingly passionate about. With Framer Motion, Iâ€™m learning how to create smooth, expressive animations that enhance the user experience without sacrificing performance or usability. From simple hover effects and page transitions to complex gesture-driven animations, Iâ€™m diving into what makes interactions feel natural, responsive, and delightful.

Iâ€™m working with React as the foundation, and Framer Motion integrates seamlessly into that ecosystem. Through these projects, Iâ€™m practicing key animation principlesâ€”like easing, staggering, layout transitions, and shared element animationsâ€”to create interfaces that feel polished and dynamic.

This repository includes a variety of components and UI experiments, such as animated menus, loaders, card interactions, and scroll-based effects. Each project is built to help me understand not just how to animate, but why certain motions make experiences more intuitive and memorable.

As I continue learning, Iâ€™m focusing on writing reusable, clean code and keeping accessibility and responsiveness in mind. I also take time to explore how motion can guide attention, communicate changes, and support user workflows.

If youâ€™re also working with Framer Motion or interested in interactive front-end development, feel free to check out the code, offer suggestions, or connect. Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smoother, more interactive web experiences, one animation at a time.
